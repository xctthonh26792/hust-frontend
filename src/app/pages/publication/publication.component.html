        <p>How do employers talk about mental health issues in their workplaces? We use survey and narrative data
          collected from Midlands firms in early 2020 prior to the first COVID-19 lockdown to examine two questions:
          <br> - What do employers understand by ‘good mental health and wellbeing in the workplace’? How do employers
          describe the impacts of mental health sickness absence on their firms?
          <br> - In the light of the Covid-19 crisis, and of follow-up interviews we conducted in July and August 2020
          after England’s first national lockdown, we also note changes in the broader business landscape which may have
          implications
          for the ways in which policymakers and employers develop and engage with workplace mental health initiatives
          in the future. </p>
        <p>
          We used depth interviews with business managers from the Midlands Engine area of England to explore the ways
          in which they and their organisations experienced mental health issues during the Covid-19 lockdown period. We
          spoke with our participants before
          and after lockdown. Four key themes emerged from the managers’ narratives.<br>Firstly, the crisis has meant
          significant changes to the ways that many people experience the workplace and this has led to a
          number of new triggers for mental health issues. <br>Secondly, mental health issues during and post-lockdown
          affected some groups of employees more, or in different ways, than others. Often, those affected were
          different from those
          who had experienced mental health issues pre-Covid.<br>Thirdly, while stigma is known to discourage people
          from disclosing mental health issues, employees may be even less likely to admit to mental health issues
          during and following
          the crisis and lockdown than before.<br>Fourthly, with increased remote working, it may be more difficult to
          identify the changes in behaviour that can signal that someone is struggling with mental health
          issues.<br>Taking account
          of these insights is important to allow employers, policymakers and mental health practitioners to be aware of
          potential issues, and to design appropriate interventions. Our findings also have implications for the future
          research
          agenda.
